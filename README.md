Facebook ID Finder
==================

This application is based on the Google App Engine Platform

Purpose
-------

Developers or normal people often need to find the numerical ID of a Facebook Page/Person either for adding a like
button or several other reasons.

This can be done quite easy with a variety of ways but all of them require more than just a simple click.

This application uses a simple form to submit a url or a string and retrieve the Facebook ID if a corresponding
page or person exists for that url.

More public data will be available as long as development on this little tiny app continues

How it works
------------

Gets the submitted url/string and then queries Facebook Graph API to find the ID
